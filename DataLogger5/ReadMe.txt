Setting up Data Logger for Igor Pro

All the files included in the package should be extracted to a folder within the User Procedures folder (ideally :Igor Pro Folder:User Procedures:Data Logger:). A shortcut to the VDT XOP should be placed in the Igor Extensions folder (VDT lives in the More Extensions:Data Acquisition: folder. You may want to put a shortcut to Data Logger.ipf in the Igor Procedures folder.

Start (or restart) Igor Pro and open the procedure file DataLogger.ipf, compile and hide the file (you can skip this step if you've put a shortcut in the Igor Procedures folder). If you have compilation errors, it's possible that there are conflicts with functions in other procedures that you use (see Advanced Details for Igor Pros).

Open the help file, Data Logger Help.ihf, for further help with getting started.
